BINGO! Here is are the constraints in KQUERY format:
State: 0x20e6d00; constraints:
array n[2] : w32 -> w8 = symbolic
(query [(Eq false
             (Eq 98 (Read w8 0 n)))]
        false)

And here is are the constraints in SMTLIB2 format:
(set-logic QF_AUFBV )
(declare-fun n () (Array (_ BitVec 32) (_ BitVec 8) ) )
(assert (=  false (=  (_ bv98 8) (select  n (_ bv0 32) ) ) ) )
(check-sat)
(exit)
