# Change Log

Changes in version MS2 (milestone 2) - 2016-07-12
  Ported interrupts, memory model and state merging from Fie
  (msp430g2553 chip only).

  * Memory model (msp430g2553/registers.cpp).
    - Return fresh symbolics for backward symbex (as they are considered
      global values which can change inside called functions and
      interruptions);
    - Return Actual values for forward symbex (interrupt handlers are
      responsble for changing their values)

  * Interrupt model (interrupts.cpp): 
    - Add more check for ADC10 interrupts (we now check CPUOFF flag,
      peripheral registers ADC10CTLx for specific bits to be set). 
    - Set new value for ADC10MEM upon ADC10 interrupt
    - Interrupts now are only executed during forward symbex.

  * State mering.
    - Check memory configuration only (and do not check if
      path conditions are the same, this should be fixed).
